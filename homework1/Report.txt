1. Performance on the development data with 100% of the training data
1a. spam precision: 0.99
1b. spam recall: 0.98
1c. spam F1 score: 0.99
1d. ham precision: 0.95
1e. ham recall: 0.98
1f. ham F1 score: 0.96

2. Performance on the development data with 10% of the training data
2a. spam precision: 0.996
2b. spam recall: 0.987
2c. spam F1 score: 0.991
2d. ham precision: 0.991
2e. ham recall: 0.997
2f. ham F1 score: 0.994

3. Description of enhancement(s) you tried (e.g., different approach(es) to smoothing, treating common words differently, dealing with unknown words differently):
Answer: I tried Add-one smoothing, already applied in Part 1. 
In Part 3, I am applying treatment to unknown words. For words that in neither hams nor spams categories, I treat them as spam words. 


4. Best performance results based on enhancements. Note that these could be the same or worse than the standard implementation.
4a. spam precision: 0.995
4b. spam recall: 0.733
4c. spam F1 score: 0.844
4d. ham precision: 0.606
4e. ham recall: 0.991
4f. ham F1 score: 0.752
This is relatively worse than the standard implementation.
