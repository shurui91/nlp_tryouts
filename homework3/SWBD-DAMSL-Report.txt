Assignment 3 Report

Name: Shurui Liu

1. If you included files other than baseline_crf.py, advanced_crf.py, evaluate_model.py, and hw3_corpus_tool.py, or modified hw3_corpus_tool.py please describe what the files do and/or your modifications to hw3_corpus_tool.py.
There is no extra files included in my submission.

2. Describe how you evaluated your baseline and advanced features.
Based on the tutorial from http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/tpeng/python-crfsuite/blob/master/examples/CoNLL%202002.ipynb and the PDF, 
the features that I have is below. 

For baseline, for one feature, it can be saved as
feature = [
	'speaker_changed': 0 or 1, 0 means did not change, 1 means changed, 
	'first_utterance': whether this is the first utterance of the dialogue, 
	'TOKEN': 'TOKEN_xxxxxx', 
	'POS': 'q'
]; 

An example could be (for one utterance)
feature = [
	0, 0, 'TOKEN_What', 'TOKEN_are', 'TOKEN_your', 'TOKEN_favorite', 'TOKEN_programs', 'TOKEN_?',
	'POS_WP', 'POS_VBP', 'POS_PRP$', 'POS_JJ', 'POS_NNS', 'POS_.'
]

Then I made a list called all_features[](two-dimensional) to store all the feature[]s in all the inputdir files like this,
all_features[] = [
	feature[], feature[], feature[], ......
]

label = [all the act_tags in all the inputdir files], label[] is one-dimensional

There are 1076 files in total so I manually picked 807 files (75%) as the training files, and the rest 269 files (25%) are the dev files. 
Then I used pycrfsuite to train the model based on the tutorial from Jupyter.

3. Describe your advanced feature set.
feature = [
	'speaker_changed': 0 or 1, 0 means did not change, 1 means changed, 
	'pos_tag_changed': 0 or 1, 0 means did not change, 1 means changed, 
	'first_utterance': whether this is the first utterance of the dialogue, 
	'TOKEN': 'TOKEN_xxxxxx', 
	'POS': 'q'
];

An example could be (for one utterance)
feature = [
	0, 0, 1, 'TOKEN_What', 'TOKEN_are', 'TOKEN_your', 'TOKEN_favorite', 'TOKEN_programs', 'TOKEN_?',
	'POS_WP', 'POS_VBP', 'POS_PRP$', 'POS_JJ', 'POS_NNS', 'POS_.'
]

4. If you tried alternate advanced feature sets, please describe them.
I only did baseline and advanced. advanced_crf.py added one more feature in the feature[] list, which is explained in Question 3. 

5. Accuracy of baseline features was: 71.077, 100 iterations. 
6. Accuracy of advanced features was: 68.555, just tiny better than baseline feature result, 100 iterations.
